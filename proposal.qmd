Methodology:

Data Collection:

We will scrape data from popular job listing platforms, including LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Monster, to gather real-time data on job openings, job descriptions, skill requirements, salary ranges, and geographical distribution.
A survey form will be administered to students to capture their career expectations, including preferred job titles, industries, and locations.

Data Analysis:

The data will be processed and analyzed to identify key trends and common job requirements in various fields related to the course.
Machine learning and natural language processing techniques might be employed to extract insights, such as in-demand skills, emerging job roles, and location-based salary expectations.

Expected Outcomes:

A detailed report highlighting job market trends and insights tailored to the expectations and aspirations of graduating students.
Visualizations and dashboards for easy interpretation of data trends and projections for specific roles and industries.
Recommendations for students on aligning their skills and experiences with market demands, based on the findings from both scraped data and survey responses.

Variables to be Created:

as we are expecting web scraping here, we might add few new variables as we try to answer the questions

External Data:

This project is expected to have scrapped data from various websites and survey forms  to get a comprehensive view of both student expectations and actual job market trends, which is ideal for a meaningful analysis.
